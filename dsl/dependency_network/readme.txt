This is a DSL of potion dependency network, including tokenizing, combinator parsing, and building semantic models.
Run the semantic_model_builder.rb to see the result, in the test unit which you could find how to use it.
But the combinator parser is very hard to understand, and change.
Also combinator parser should be support automatically generation in the future.
